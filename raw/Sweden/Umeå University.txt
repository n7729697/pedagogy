AI Policy at UID
At Umeå Institute of Design we would like to emphasize the importance of maintaining responsible and critical engagement when adopting emerging tools and technologies. Our policy regarding the use of Artificial Intelligence (AI) tools is based on the principles of experimentation, critical engagement, transparency and responsibility.

We welcome our teachers and students to experiment with new AI tools and technologies, and to explore the potential benefits and limitations of these tools in the context of our academic programmes. By experimenting with AI tools, we hope to gain a deeper understanding of their capabilities and identify opportunities to enhance our future professional practices.

We recognize that the development of new skills is essential to effectively engage with AI tools. Therefore, we believe our teachers and students should develop their AI-related skills and knowledge through experimentation.

We stress the importance of critical engagement with these emerging tools. While they can enhance teaching and learning, we must remain vigilant and assess the potential impact they can have on our practices and society. We must consider the ethical implications of AI, and ensure that its use aligns with UID’s values.

We believe that transparency is key to responsible use of technology. All of us must provide clear information on how AI tools have been used in our work and for what purpose.

Finally, we expect students and teachers to take responsibility for the AI tools they choose to use. We need to ensure that content provided to and from AI tools is accurate, unbiased, and protected. Teachers and students must use AI tools in a responsible and ethical manner, and report any issues or concerns to the appropriate authorities.

In summary, our policy on AI use is based on experimentation, learning, critical engagement, transparency, and responsibility. We believe that by following these principles, we can ensure the responsible use these tools, and maximize their benefits for teaching and learning practices at UID.
